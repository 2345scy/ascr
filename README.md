# SECR

Traditionally, analysis of capture-recapture data is generally carried out with the implicit assumption of constant capture probability between animals. This ignores an obvious spatial component; organisms close to traps are more likely to be capture than those that are far away. Explicitly accounting for an individual's location provides additional information from which to infer animal density. 

These functions fit spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models in AD Model Builder and R.
